Create a face detection android app using machine learning kit on firebase.

- Everyone has listened about the face detection program built using python but here we are going to create an android app using machine learning kit on firebase which will do the same stuff as the python program.
- It will be a simple app with a simple UI in which the user will be greeted with a camera button on the home page to open a camera and then it will detect the face and show the result in an alert dialog box.
- Reference material for the same will be on the next slide.
